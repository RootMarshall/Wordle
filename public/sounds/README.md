# Sound Library

Place custom sound files here to use in the game.

## Correct letter sound (green tile)

- **File**: `correct.mp3` or `correct.wav`
- **When**: Plays when a letter is revealed as correct (green)
- **Suggested**: Short ding, chime, or success tone (~0.2–0.5 seconds)

If no file is present, the game uses a built-in synthesized ding.
